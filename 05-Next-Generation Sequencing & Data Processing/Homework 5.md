# Overview

This assignment guides you through a bioinformatics workflow using NCBI databases and Galaxy. You'll download a single DNA sequencing dataset from NCBI SRA, locate a reference sequence from NCBI RefSeq, and then use Galaxy to analyze your data.

# Assignment questions:

1) Navigate to the NCBI SRA Database and locate a DNA project of interest. Download a single FASTQ file for this assignment.
2) Navigate to NCBI Refseq and locate a reference sequence appropriate for your dataset.  
3) Using Galaxy Bioinformatics, 
        - Create an account and verify your email address. 
        - Upload the FASTQ file to Galaxy
        - Run FASTQC to assess sequence quality (available as an html).
            -   In what areas does your data pass quality checks?
            -   In what areas does it fail?
            -   What is the overall quality of the dataset?
        - Select a quality filtering and adapter removal algorithm and run it on raw FASTQ reads.
        - Align high-quality reads to the reference using whichever tool is most appropriate for your data.
        - <b>BONUS:</b> Try this bioinformatics workflow with command-line tools.
